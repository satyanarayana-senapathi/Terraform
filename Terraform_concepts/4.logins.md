# DIFFERENT WAYS OF AUTHENTICATION TO TERRAFORM

# 1. Application Default Credentials (ADC):

The `gcloud auth application-default` commands are used to manage Application Default Credentials. The following guide explains how to use `gcloud auth application-default login` to set up Application Default Credentials on your local machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command:
```markdown
   gcloud auth application-default login

   ```

3. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Google Cloud account. This may involve opening a web page, selecting your Google Cloud project, and granting necessary permissions.

4. After successful authentication, your local environment will be configured with Application Default Credentials. You'll now be able to run applications locally that use these credentials to access Google Cloud APIs.

**Note:** The `gcloud auth application-default login` command is specifically designed for setting up Application Default Credentials in a local development environment. In a production environment or on Google Cloud services, you might use service accounts directly without the need for this command.

# 2.gcloud Command-Line Interface (CLI):
- gcloud is the command-line interface for Google Cloud. It provides a set of commands for interacting with various GCP services.
- You use gcloud to perform tasks such as managing resources, deploying applications, and configuring GCP settings.

# 3.Service Accounts:
- Service accounts are used to authenticate applications and instances to access Google Cloud APIs and services.
- When you create a service account, you can download a JSON key file associated with that service account.
- This file contains the credentials that allow your applications to authenticate as the service account.
  
**Activate your GCP service account:**
```markdown
gcloud auth activate-service-account {service-account-name}@{project-id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com --project={project-id} --key-file="PATH\filename.json"
 ```

**Environment variable for Terraform authentication:**

```markdown
cmd# setx GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS "PATH\filename.json"
ps# $Env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="PATH\filename.json"

 ```
# 4.Impersonating a service account 
Impersonating a service account in the context of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) typically refers to assuming the identity of a service account to perform actions on behalf of that service account. This is often used for testing or troubleshooting purposes.

1. **Authenticate as the Impersonator:**
   - Ensure that you are already authenticated with a Google Cloud account that has the necessary permissions to impersonate the target service account.

   ```bash
   gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account [TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
   ```
2. **Impersonate the Service Account:**
   - Use the `gcloud auth` command to impersonate the service account. Replace `[TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with the email address of the service account you want to impersonate.

   ```bash
   gcloud projects list --impersonate-service-account=[TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
   ```

3. **Verify Impersonation:**
   - You can verify that you are now impersonating the service account by checking the current account:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth list
   ```

   The output should show the impersonated service account as the active account.

4. **Perform Actions as Impersonated Account:**
   - Once impersonated, any actions performed using `gcloud` or other Google Cloud tools will be executed with the permissions of the impersonated service account.
5. **Print Access Token:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account [TARGET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
   ```

6. **Stop Impersonation:**
   - To stop impersonating and revert to the original account, you can deactivate the impersonated account:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth revoke
   ```

   This will return to the previously authenticated account.

**Note:** Be cautious when impersonating service accounts, and ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to do so. Impersonation is a powerful capability and should be used responsibly. Additionally, consult the documentation specific to the Google Cloud services or tools you are working with for any service-specific considerations.
